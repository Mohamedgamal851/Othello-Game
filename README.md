# Othello-Game
Implement the strategy board game Othello for two players on an 8Ã—8 board. Players place disks to outflank and flip the opponent's disks, aiming to have the majority of disks in their color by the end. Black moves first. If no legal move is available, the player passes. The game ends when no moves are possible or a player runs out of pieces.
